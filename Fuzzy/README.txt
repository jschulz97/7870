Setup
In order to run my code, it is necessary to have Python 3.0+ installed, as well as libraries listed below:
-	numpy
-	matplotlib
-	progressbar2

Test Code
To run the test code, navigate to the ‘src’ directory in my source code and run:
	python tests.py
Code will run without the raw data, but to download full test data, navigate to the following address in your favorite internet browser:
	https://jschulz.dev/project2_test_data.zip
Then unzip the file and place the “data” directory into the “Fuzzy” directory.
